## The Parody 😄

This website satirizes corporate "version upgrades" that promise to fix past mistakes but often just add complexity. Infinity 2.0 includes:

- Buzzword-heavy feature descriptions
- Overly optimistic statistics (400% more efficient!)
- Corporate speak and marketing language
- References to trendy tech (AI, Blockchain, Cloud)
- Classic Office character quotes and situations
- The promise of fixing all V1.0 problems (with new ones introduced)

## Screenshots 📸

The website features a modern, professional design that significantly improves on the original V1 mockup, with both desktop and mobile responsive layouts.
