## Context
- PR #3 updates the slab crate to address an out-of-bounds bug in Slab::get_disjoint_mut.
- Preliminary repo search found no direct usage of get_disjoint_mut, but transitive dependencies could still exercise the vulnerable code path.

## Tasks
- Confirm slab version in Cargo.lock is >= 0.4.11 across all crates/workspaces.
- Repo-wide search for:
  - direct usages: Slab, get_disjoint_mut
  - any helper wrappers that might call it indirectly
- Inspect transitive dependency graph:
  - cargo tree -i slab
  - note any crates pinning slab < 0.4.11
- Run dependency security checks:
  - cargo audit
  - (optional) cargo deny check advisories
- If any exposure is found:
  - bump/override versions as needed
  - add a regression test or deny rule to prevent slab < 0.4.11
- Document findings and resolution in this issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Verified no code paths use the vulnerable method or all vulnerable versions eliminated.
- Security scan(s) pass.
- Notes added here summarizing findings and any changes made.
